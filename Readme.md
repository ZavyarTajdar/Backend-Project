# 🚀 JS & Backend – Mega Project  

Welcome to the **JS & Backend Mega Project**, a **full-featured YouTube-style backend system** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
This project goes beyond simple demos — it’s a **production-grade implementation** of a modern backend, designed to teach and showcase how real-world platforms are engineered.  

It follows **industry best practices**, a **modular architecture**, and a **scalable codebase**, making it a perfect starting point for learning, personal projects, or even enterprise-level applications.

## ✨ Core Features  

### 🔑 Authentication & Security  
- **JWT Authentication** with refresh & access tokens.  
- **Secure Cookie Handling** for persistent sessions.  
- **Role-based Authorization** (e.g., Admin, User).  
- **Password Hashing & Salting** with bcrypt.  
- **Rate Limiting & Security Headers** to prevent common attacks.  

### 🗄 Database & Data Models  
- **MongoDB Integration** with Mongoose.  
- **Robust Schema Design** for Users, Videos, Comments, Likes, Subscriptions, and Playlists.  
- **Aggregation Pipelines** for analytics (views, trending videos, etc.).  

### 📂 Code Architecture  
- **Clean & Modular Structure** (controllers, routes, services, utils).  
- **MVC-inspired Pattern** for clarity and maintainability.  
- **Reusable Middlewares** for validation, authentication, and error handling.  

### 📦 Media & File Handling  
- **Multer-based File Uploads** for videos & thumbnails.  
- **Cloud-ready Storage** (easily configurable).  
- **File Validation** (size, type, limits).  

### ⚡ API Utilities  
- **Centralized Error Handling** with custom error classes.  
- **Consistent API Response Wrapper** for success & failure.  
- **Pagination, Filtering & Search** support for videos & comments.  

### 📊 User & Video Features  
- ✅ User Registration, Login, Profile Management.  
- 🎬 Video Upload, Edit, Delete, and Publish/Unpublish.  
- 💬 Comment System with CRUD operations.  
- 👍 Like/Unlike functionality for Videos & Comments.  
- 🔔 Subscription System (subscribe/unsubscribe channels).  
- 🎶 Playlist Management with Add/Remove videos.  

### 🛡 Production-Grade Practices  
- **Environment Variables** managed with dotenv.  
- **CORS Setup** for cross-origin requests.  
- **Helmet.js** for HTTP security headers.  
- **Scalable Folder Structure** for enterprise growth.  
- **Deployment Ready** for Render, Vercel, or AWS.

## 📌 Why This Project?  

Most tutorials only scratch the surface with basic CRUD apps. This project aims to:  
- Replicate **real-world complexity** of a platform like YouTube.  
- Teach **scalable architecture** instead of spaghetti code.  
- Provide a **foundation you can extend** into a production system.  
- Help you master **MongoDB aggregations, authentication flows, and middleware design** in depth.
